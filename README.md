## My Game Projects ##
### (Suspended - Jul 2021) Mesopotamia ###
A 2.5D game featuring crop/ creator taming towards a prosperous human community.

Suspended due to insufficient core mechanics.

### (Suspended - Nov 2021) Extraction Plan ###
A 2.5D game I refer to as "Ed Stafdord: Left for Dead Simulator". You play as a rookie survivor trying to film your first survival TV program.

Suspended due to the lack of ability to build 1) realistic terrain and corresponding character movement/ animation 2) reponsive objects in 2.5D environment.

### (Ongoing) Nature Geographic ###
A 2D game where you play as a Nature Geographic photographer, trying to get great photos while struggling to stay alive. This is a modification of the project *Extraction Plan* - lower the dimension, higher the chance to get it done.
